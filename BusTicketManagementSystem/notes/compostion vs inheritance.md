# compostion vs inheriance:

- both shows relationship between classes
- using compostion we can have multiple inheriance i.e we can use multiple classes
- compostion : has-a relationship
  inheriance : is-a relationship

### example :

we have a class Car and Engine --> if we want to use the Engine class objects in Car class as an instance variable, we can use compostion. car _has-a_ engine
