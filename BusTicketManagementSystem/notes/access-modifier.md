# Access Modifier Accessibility Description

public is Accessible from any other class in any package.
protected is Accessible within the same package and by subclasses in any package.
default is Accessible only within classes in the same package.
private is Accessible only within the same class.

Additional Considerations

    Inheritance: Protected members are particularly relevant in inheritance scenarios. They allow subclasses to have access to methods and variables they inherit.
    Encapsulation: Private access is a key part of encapsulation, allowing the internal workings of a class to be hidden from the outside world.
    Access Modifiers with Interfaces: All members of an interface are implicitly public. In Java, you cannot have private or protected members in an interface (before Java 9; starting from Java 9, private methods can be defined in interfaces, but they are not accessible outside of that interface).
